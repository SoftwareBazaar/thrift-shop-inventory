## 📊 Understanding Data Storage

### **How It Works:**

Data is stored in each user's browser. This means:
- ✅ Fast and reliable
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ Private and secure
- ⚠️ Data stays on that device

### **Sharing Data:**

Currently, each device has its own data. To share across all devices on your network, you'll need to upgrade to a network deployment (see PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for details).

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

1. **Change Default Password** immediately
2. **Create unique passwords** for each user
3. **Log out** when done
4. **Don't share passwords**
5. **Clear browser cache** only when necessary
